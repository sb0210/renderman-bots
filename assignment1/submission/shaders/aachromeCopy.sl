 * aachrome: anti-aliased reflective chrome shader.
 * This shader shoots 'samples' rays to reduce aliasing in directly visible
 * surfaces.  It only shoots 1 ray at secondary reflections to avoid an
 * exponential explosion in the number of rays.
 *
 * Warning: only use this shader on objects that have normals facing out!
